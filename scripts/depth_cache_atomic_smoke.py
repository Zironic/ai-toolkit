"""Regression tests for atomic/Windows-safe depth-cache I/O helpers.

Covers the two private helpers added in ``toolkit/depth_consistency.py``:

  * ``_atomic_save_file`` — temp-file + ``os.replace`` write so that an
    in-place rewrite of a safetensors cache cannot trip Windows
    ``ERROR_USER_MAPPED_FILE (1224)`` when the destination is mmap'd.
  * ``_load_then_close`` — load a safetensors cache and force-release the
    mmap handle so a subsequent overwrite of the same path succeeds on
    Windows.

The depth-cache crash on Windows hit the exact load → augment → save path
exercised here (multi-bucket training writes the same per-image cache file
under different bucket keys). These checks are pure-stdlib + safetensors,
CPU-only, and never load DA2, so they belong in fast smoke coverage rather
than the GPU-bound ``depth_consistency_smoke.py``.

Run: ``python scripts/depth_cache_atomic_smoke.py`` — exits 0 on success.
